In the battle for combat sports supremacy, the UFC and boxing have long been rivals, each vying for the attention of fans around the world. While both offer thrilling action inside the ring or cage, their approaches to promotion couldn't be more different. As a contrarian boxing analyst, it's time to explore how the UFC's promotion of the sport contrasts with boxing's focus on individual stars, ultimately stunting the full growth of the sport.

## The UFC: Promoting the Sport, Not Just the Fighters

In the world of mixed martial arts, the UFC stands out for its holistic approach to promotion. Yes, they have their fair share of superstars like Conor McGregor and Ronda Rousey, but what sets the UFC apart is its emphasis on promoting the sport itself. Every event is marketed as a showcase of the best MMA talent in the world, with exciting matchups and storylines that appeal to both hardcore fans and casual viewers alike.

Take, for example, UFC 229: Khabib vs. McGregor. While the headline fight between Khabib Nurmagomedov and Conor McGregor drew massive attention, the entire event was stacked with compelling matchups across different weight classes, showcasing the depth of talent in the UFC roster. This approach ensures that even if a marquee fighter is absent, fans still tune in for the overall quality of the event.

## Boxing's Cult of Personality

In contrast, boxing has long been dominated by the cult of personality, with promoters and networks often prioritizing the promotion of a select few stars over the sport itself. While this strategy may lead to short-term financial gains for promoters and fighters alike, it ultimately comes at the expense of the sport's broader appeal and growth.

A prime example of this is the Mayweather vs. McGregor fight in 2017. While it generated enormous revenue and captured the public's attention, it was largely a spectacle built around the personalities of Floyd Mayweather and Conor McGregor rather than a celebration of the sport of boxing itself.

Additionally, consider the recent postponement of Tyson Fury's fight due to injury. The entire card was built around Fury's highly anticipated matchup, and when he got injured, the entire event was postponed, leaving fans disappointed and the promotion scrambling to salvage the situation.

## The Impact on Growth

The UFC's approach to promotion has undoubtedly played a significant role in the explosive growth of mixed martial arts over the past two decades. By prioritizing the sport itself over individual personalities, the UFC has been able to attract a diverse audience and cultivate a global fan base that is passionate about MMA as a whole.

On the other hand, boxing's focus on promoting a select few stars has led to stagnation in certain aspects of the sport. For example, when fighters like Tyson Fury and Artur Beterbiev got injured, resulting in the cancellation of marquee matchups, the entire card suffered, and the event looked ordinary without the anticipated main attraction.

## Conclusion: A Call for Change

As a contrarian boxing analyst, it's clear that the UFC's promotion of the sport sets a powerful example for boxing to follow. By shifting the focus away from individual stars and towards the sport itself, boxing could unlock its full potential and attract a new generation of fans who are passionate about the sweet science.

It's time for boxing promoters and networks to recognize the importance of promoting the sport as a whole, rather than relying solely on the star power of a select few fighters. Only then can boxing reach new heights and reclaim its status as the world's premier combat sport.
